    Order Rationale: We started with add recipe first in order to ensure that we have recipes in the database to work
    with on future PBIs. We also added save recipes second in order to have a persistent database to work with on future
    PBIs. Next we covered viewing the recipes so that we could work on UI and ensure that formatting is legible and
    accessible. We need to be able to browse recipes in the user database as the next step. We know that the user should
    be able to delete recipes and edit recipes so these are next. The stakeholder wanted to be able to tag the recipes
    in order to accommodate a future filter so we thought this could go along with editing and annotating the recipes.
    The users want to share recipes with their loved ones so we want to implement that next. Lastly we wanted to begin
    on filtering and searching functionality. We picked these for the first sprint so that we would have a solid
    foundation for implementation of future features that the stakeholders requested.

SPRINT PLANNING:
    Definition of Ready:
        - PBI has an estimated size (and it should be small)
        - PBI is clearly articulated and not ambiguous
        - PBI is expressed as a user story (“As a ______, I want ______ so that I can ______”)
        - PBI has definition of done
        - All dependencies for PBI are known
        - Developers have had the opportunity to ask questions
