### BACKLOG:

[Jira Backlog](https://doylead.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/E71/boards/2/backlog?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZjliZTg5YmI3ZGY2NDljOWJjMmM3OTM2ZjNhNzVlNGMiLCJwIjoiaiJ9&cloudId=56827f1d-9c14-485c-8ee9-3e41b8b2df97&selectedIssue=E71-16)

**Order Rationale:** We picked these for the first sprint so that we would have a solid foundation for implementation 
of future features that the stakeholders required.

The first thing the user needs to be able to do is add an account so that they can begin storing 
their recipes. Once the user has an account they need to be able to add their recipes. The user also needs to be
to save their newly created recipe. After the user has created and saved their recipes, they need to be able to
view them in a format that is legible and accessible. The user also needs to be able to browse all of their stored 
recipes. The user may encounter a recipe that they did not like so the user needs to be able to delete or edit this 
recipe. The user would also like a more efficient way to search through their recipes so the user wants to introduce
tagging and filtering by tag. The user must be able to create a tag and then filter their own recipes by that tag.
The user also needs to be able to view their recipes remotely in case they want to add something to their cart at
the grocery store. Next, the user wants to take notes on their recipe in order to accommodate preferences of people
that they may be cooking for. The user next wants to share their recipes with their loved ones. Lastly, the user
wants to filter the recipe by cook time so that they do not pick complicated recipes to make on a busy week night.
