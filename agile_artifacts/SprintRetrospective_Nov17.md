Attendees: Andrew, Danny, Mark, Veronica, Karun

Pros:
* We are starting to find a rhythm, and we appear to have found a meeting cadence that works for us
* Forcing meetings to end after 2 hours or at 9 PM gave us better balance
  * Our update after last "sprint" appears to have succeeded!

Areas for improvement:
* We could try to add pair programming sessions.  This would allow us to move faster, and would help address difficulties with scheduling mob programming sessions
  * There are a lot of areas for "quick wins"
  * Communication would become more challenging - we'd have to make sure to talk about changes made between mob programming sessions.  Use markdown files and slack
* When working together, it would be helpful to focus on one topic at a time.  We have a tendency to jump around a bit

Action for next time:
* In addition to meetings we had this week, have two distinct pair programming sessions.
