Reflection on Previous Action Item (Pair Programming Sessions):
* Pair programming sessions were very productive
* Pair programming sessions were also *very* hard to schedule ad hoc.  Sometimes we simply failed to have
overlapping schedules
* Pair programming generally had different social dynamics

Pros:
* Doing independent research between sessions has been quite helpful
* Meeting length limits (two hours or at 9 PM Eastern) continues to work for us
* We improved our ability to focus on one topic at a time

Areas for improvement:
* Asking team members to make a commitment to independent research, perhaps delegating research topics.
We may want more than one developer looking at the same topic
* Is there a way to incorporate behavior driven development?
* Discuss availability for pair programming sessions during daily scrums *and* over Slack

Action for next time:
* We want to leverage independent research.  We will construct a list of topics at the end of each mob
session and distribute topics among team members.  The expectation is that each team member will spend
at least 30 minutes researching that topic prior to the next working session
