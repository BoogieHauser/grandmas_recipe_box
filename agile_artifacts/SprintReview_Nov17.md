Attendees: Andrew, Danny, Mark, Veronica, Karun, Vani (Stakeholder)

We briefly described our basic project structure so far with Vani, including functionality we expect to be working.

Stakeholder questions:
* Are all fields mandatory?
* How can we edit recipes?

Stakeholder feedback:
* Users may not have prep/cook time available, and they may not distinguish between these.  Perhaps these fields should not be required.
* Similarly, for some recipes (e.g. icing for a cake) the notion of "Servings" seems a bit odd.  Perhaps this field should not be required.

Suggestions:
* Stakeholder considers the ability to edit a recipe a "must have"
* Stakeholder would like to be able to add an image, either when adding a recipe or when viewing the recipe itself
* In the farther future, stakeholder would like to be able to upload a video
* Stakeholder would like to be able to share contents over email
* Stakeholder isn't as interested in reviewing recipes
* Stakeholder wants the ability to have privacy (recipes will not be required to be public)
* Stakeholder has suggested that they are more interested in *functionality* than *style*
* They've suggested the most important features for the next sprint, in their view, are editing recipes, taggings recipes, and filtering recipes
