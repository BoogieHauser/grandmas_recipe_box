Reflection on Previous Action Item (Independent Research)):
* We were able to hit the ground running on Wednesday
* Members appreciated getting to feel more prepared for time together

Pros:
* Pair programming continues to be hugely effective
* Sticking to the backlog/using user stories as organization
* Having a regular schedule really helps

Areas for improvement:
* We may benefit from splitting mob programming sessions to pair programming
sessions even if everyone is available
* Timing commits/pushes with user stories, or other mechanisms to commit to version control more often

Action for next time:
* Splitting mob programming time into paired pair programming (or similar) with orthogonal user stories
